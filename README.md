# 🚀 **ASTRO·SHAPE** 🌌

**Description**  
*ASTRO·SHAPE* is a game similar to *Hole in the Wall*, designed for microgravity environments like space stations. It uses human pose estimation algorithms to create a silhouette based on predefined coordinates, and the player's goal is to adjust their pose to match the projected silhouette. The system detects whether players align with the silhouette using computer vision algorithms and a camera.

**Benefits in Microgravity** 🌍✨  
Microgravity environments allow for greater flexibility in the variety of poses astronauts can make, boosting the interaction and fun of the game. It helps maintain physical activity as players must move to adjust their poses, which is essential to counteract the effects of microgravity, such as muscle loss and bone density reduction.

Additionally, *ASTRO·SHAPE* serves as a cognitive exercise, helping astronauts keep their minds sharp by engaging in quick decision-making and spatial awareness tasks. The game also mitigates the **Vection Effect**, a sensation of movement experienced when visual stimuli suggest motion, but the body is stationary. This effect is common in space and can lead to disorientation and discomfort. By requiring active body movements that align with visual input, the game helps the brain better synchronize visual and physical sensations, reducing the impact of vection.

**Game Objective** 🎯  
The main goal is to promote physical activity and mental well-being for astronauts, enhancing team cohesion and providing entertainment on long missions. The interactive and physically demanding nature of the game contributes to the resilience and adaptability of players in extraterrestrial environments.
