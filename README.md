# 🚀 **ASTRO·SHAPE** 🌌

**Description**  
*ASTRO·SHAPE* is a game similar to *Hole in the Wall*, designed for microgravity environments like space stations. It uses human pose estimation algorithms to create a silhouette based on predefined coordinates, and the player's goal is to adjust their pose to match the projected silhouette. The system detects whether players align with the silhouette using computer vision algorithms and a camera.

**Benefits in Microgravity** 🌍✨  
Microgravity environments allow for greater flexibility in the variety of poses astronauts can make, boosting the interaction and fun of the game. It helps maintain physical activity as players must move to adjust their poses. This is essential to counteract the effects of microgravity, such as muscle loss and bone density reduction.

**Game Objective** 🎯  
The main goal is to promote physical activity and mental well-being for astronauts, enhancing team cohesion and providing entertainment on long missions. The interactive and physically demanding nature of the game contributes to the resilience and adaptability of players in extraterrestrial environments.

**Technologies Used** 💻🔧  
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and camera handling.
- **Mediapipe**: For human pose detection.
- **PySide6**: For the graphical interface.
- **Numpy**: For numerical processing and visualization.
- **Pygame**: For background music and additional visual effects.
